**Challenges:**
I couldn't get a 3rd model working, ultimately I would like several different
types of baked goods to be in the collection.

**Future Add-On's:**
1.  I would really like a more personalized site where you can have an encrypted log-in
with special user access.
1.  I would like the home page icons to take the user to the base of the home page to view a portion of the galleries and then once those are clicked it would prompt the user to log-in or create an account.  

Here is a copy of the original landing page that I made on Photoshop. I didn't end up using it because it wasn't responsive.

Here are some of the images I used, they are from my personal journey from my former life as a Pastry Chef.
