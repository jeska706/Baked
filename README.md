A Web app photo gallery for baked goods

Welcome to Baked
where you can view and add images of baked goods and create a personal gallery.

#####The technology used for this project:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Json, Node.Js, Mongo, Heroku, Photoshop

#####The node-modules used here are:
EJS, Mongoose, Body-Parser, Method-Override, & Express

#####Here's a link to my live page :

#####Challenges:
I couldn't get a 3rd model working, ultimately I would like several different
types of baked goods to be in the collection.

#####Future Add-On's:
1.  I would really like a more personalized site where you can have an encrypted log-in
with special user access.
1.  I would like the home page icons to take the user to the base of the home page to view a portion of the galleries and then once those are clicked it would prompt the user to log-in or create an account.
