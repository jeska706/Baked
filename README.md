**####Challenges:**
I couldn't get a 3rd model working, ultimately I would like several different
types of baked goods to be in the collection.

**####Future Add-On's:**
1.  I would really like a more personalized site where you can have an encrypted log-in
with special user access.
1.  I would like the home page icons to take the user to the base of the home page to view a portion of the galleries and then once those are clicked it would prompt the user to log-in or create an account.
